TEST 2: GUARDIAN REAL-TIME DETECTION


TEST SCENARIO:
Created file with intentional Unicode corruption
  File: C:\Projects\UNICODE_CORRUPTION_TEST.txt
  Bytes: Hello [0xFF 0xFE] World
  Type: Invalid UTF-8 start byte (0xFF at position 6)

DETECTION PHASE:
  Guardian scan interval: 30 seconds
  Time to detection: < 30 seconds 
  Detection method: Python UTF-8 decode attempt

 DETECTION RESULT:
   [2025-11-26 02:54:25]  REAL CORRUPTION DETECTED
   File: C:\Projects\UNICODE_CORRUPTION_TEST.txt
   Reason: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 6
   Status: DETECTED SUCCESSFULLY 

 QUARANTINE PHASE:
   Corrupted file backed up to:
   C:\Users\kyleh\unicode_quarantine\20251126_025425_UNICODE_CORRUPTION_TEST.txt
   Original bytes preserved: 72 101 108 108 111 32 255 254 87 111 114 108 100
   Status: QUARANTINED SUCCESSFULLY 

 FIX PHASE:
   Encoding repair attempted: YES
   Fixed file content: "Hello World"
   UTF-8 validation: PASSED 
   File readable: YES 
   Status: FIXED SUCCESSFULLY 

 VERIFICATION PHASE:
   Next scan (#2): All 252 files valid UTF-8 
   Corruption re-detected: NO (fixed properly) 
   False positives: 0 
   Status: FIX VERIFIED 

GUARDIAN STATISTICS:
  Total scans: 15+
  Files monitored: 252
